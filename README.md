# Database
The following is a semester long group project for Principles of Database class. The purpose of this project was to create from scratch an E-Commerce Application (Think Amazon, Ebay, etc.) that used a database. This involves saving customer logins, information, and purchases. This also meant we had to save item and seller information. This projectâ€™s back-end was done using MySql workbench with a server connection provided by Stony Brook University. The front-end interface was created using JavaFX.
